        Hello there! My name is Andrewval; I'm a senior at Oakland University,
        going for my Bachelor's in Computer Science, and I am 21 years old! I am
        currently aiming to finish my time here at Oakland, get my degree, and
        apply to a Catholic Monastery. I am very religious, I live with my
        parents and my german shepherd, Nishra. I am a Chaldean Catholic,
        meaning I am from a minority population of Catholics in the Middle East
        who have faced persecution ever since they've been there. We speak a
        dialect of Aramaic (the original language of Jesus) called Chaldean
        Neo-Classical Aramaic. My family moved to Canada in the 90's, and then
        here right before the turn of the Century. Currently I am employed full
        time, and enrolled full time. If you'd like to know more about me, check
        out my
